        "description": " Liquid Love is a collective journey exploring playfulness and the sensuality of flowing skin to skin contact using warm olive oil. The concept is simple: we will pour warm, fine, olive oil on to your skin, from where it will spread out over you body and form a lubricious substance, which allows you to float in a sea together with other oily bodies. Everyone is invited to respect their own rhythm and limits to touch and nudity. We invite you to move and allow yourself to be moved without intentions or sexual orientation. Releasing our usual desire to take action on erotic sensations and thoughts we invite you to be present with them and to relax into the energetic flow of the bodies around you. This is a place where you can love and be loved in an impersonal and unbound manner and above all a place to super charge your soul.\u2028 \u2028***** The PAL System ***** It is important to us to create a safe, trusting, and responsible environment where you can feel comfortable in the presence of other people in the group. To help us with this we are using the PAL System. The PAL System asks that you attend a session together with someone you know and trust – a PAL. Whatever your gender, and no matter how you identify, we ask the following: * Please book and arrive to a session with your PAL. You will not be able to join the session if your PAL fails to turn up, and we will not be able to refund your costs/tickets. * You and your PAL must both pay for a space in the session. *Your PAL does not have to be someone who has already attended a session with us.   * Your PAL can be the same gender or another gender.  Due to the intimate size of our sessions we ask that you do not PAL with more than one person.  * We ask that your PAL is someone you know well and trust.  You are both accountable for the behaviour of the other.  Please keep this in mind when agreeing to PAL another person. * Your PAL does not have to be a lover or a partner. Your PAL can be any friend or even a relative. (The PAL System is Creative Commons licensed to Kinky Salon San Francisco) \u2028***  What happens at a Liquid Love session?  ***Each session has a different group of people, and therefore each session is different. However, to give you some idea of the flow of a session, we begin by getting to know each other as we talk about the experience we are going to share. You will then ready yourself on the specially prepared surface. As warm oil is poured over the body, you wil be guided through an exploration of yourself and others around you. We encourage non-verbal communication in this part of the afternoon. *** Do people have sex at Liquid Love? *** No. Liquid Love is explicitly a non-penetration, non-ejaculation space.  These boundaries are strictly held during our sessions. *** Do I have to be naked? ***Our sessions are clothing optional. We invite participants, following our introduction, to undress to whatever level they feel comfortable with – bearing in mind that whatever you choose to leave on will inevitably be covered in oil. There will be nudity in the room and it&#39;s important that you feel at ease with it. *** Will I be touched by other people / Can I touch other people? ***Again, each session is different. You are not expected to touch anyone, and you do not have to be touched by anyone. Within the space you are able to experience Liquid Love on your own, or interact with those comfortable with touching and/or being touched. We invite you to explore both dynamics during your session. We view Liquid Love as a unique skin-contact experience. We invite you to be open to both touching as well as being touched. We particularly invite you to explore touch using parts of the body we do not usually touch with – our stomachs, our noses, our feet, our shoulders, our heads, our buttocks, our eyelashes, and so on. We ask that you constantly check-in with the people you are interacting with so to ensure that you are not crossing their personal boundaries We ask participants to practice a ‘two-taps’ signal to clearly indicate that you do not wish to be touched. We demonstrate this to all participants during our initial conversation and ask you to respect the system during the session. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, for whatever reason, we ask you to raise your hand so that your facilitators can quickly attend to you. The space is safely and responsibly held throughout the session. Within the boundaries discussed at the outset, you are invited to explore the experience in whatever way makes you feel most comfortable. \u2028***  Who can attend? Do you gender balance the sessions?  *** Liquid Love is open to people of all genders and sexual orientations. There is an atmosphere of respect and acceptance at all times. We like to ensure a good mix of people and personalities in the room, and so do not strictly gender balance (i.e. one man to one woman) our sessions. We invite you to move beyond personal preference and ideas of sexual attraction, into a space of welcoming and appreciating everyone.\u2028***  What kind of oil do you use?  ***We use olive oil, which we have found works best. It feels lovely on the skin, and we add a few drops of lavender oil to give it a fresh aroma\u2028***  Will the oil get in my eyes?  ***Depending on the session and the way you interact with yourself and others, this may occur. We use olive oil, which, in our experience, is gentlest on the eyes. Some people may feel a mild sting, or experience hazy vision if oil gets in their eyes. Your facilitators have paper-towels on hand throughout the session. If at any point you would like to wipe your eyes, simply raise your hand and a paper towel will be brought to you.\u2028***  I have piercings / jewellery – is this okay?  ***For the safety of all the other people taking part in the session, we ask that you remove all sharp/pointy piercings and jewellery. We will provide the group with a small box where you may leave your belongings for the duration of the session\u2028 *** Health & Safety *** Due to the intimate nature of Liquid Love, with lots of body to body contact happening - which is always completely optional - we ask that you respect and take the following precautions: •No open cuts or wounds are permitted in the space * No untrimmed toenails are permitted in the space.  Untrimmed toenails are a high hygiene risk and we reserve the right to ask you not to take part if we feel that your personal hygiene presents a risk to others. •Please ensure you have informed the hosts if you are pregnant or have any specific medical conditions they need to be aware of. •If you have any contagious and/or active infectious such as: Fever, flu, active outbreak of herpes or any other STIs you&#39;ll unfortunately not be able to attend for the safety of the group, we trust that you will respect this request and understand that tickets are non refundable/non transferable. •Our events are a supportive and safe space and there&#39;s absolutely no judgement if you can&#39;t make it for the above reasons. Due to time restrictions and to maintain absolute discretion please get in touch prior to the event if you&#39;d like to discuss these points further as there won&#39;t be available time once you arrive at the venue. •Please make sure you shower prior and arrive fresh and lovely. ***  What are my transport options getting to the session?  *** The residence is a one-minute walk from All Saints Station on the DLR. In addition, Buses D6, 15, 115, D7 and D8 also stop a minute walk away. There is plenty of free parking in the surrounding streets. ***. What should I bring with me?  ***We ask that you bring with you a towel you are not precious about (you do not mind oil getting on it). We recommend wearing someting comfortable which you are also not precious about (again, the oil). ***  Is my ticket transferrable / refundable?  *** Once you have purchased a ticket, if you change your mind, you have 24 hours after purchase to cancel and receive a refund. After 24 hours, tickets are non-refundable, non-transferable to other people other than those registered on the booking and non-transferable to other event dates.   Please note that any tickets purchased within 24 hours of the start of the session are non-refundable. Please ensure that your PAL is able to attend with you! We will not be able to admit you to the session unless you arrive with your PAL, and we will not be able to refund your ticket if your PAL fails to turn up. Please take this into consideration prior to booking . Thank you for your understanding and co-operation with this. ***  How can I get in touch with you?  ***Please email us with any query you have!theliquidloveexperience@gmail.com ",
